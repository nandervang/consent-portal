## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
A study participant receives an invitation to participate in an academic research study. They visit the consent portal, authenticate using Bank ID to verify their identity, review the study information and consent PDF document, and provide informed consent to participate. Researchers can then manage studies and track consent status.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a study participant has received a study invitation, **When** they visit the consent portal and authenticate with Bank ID, **Then** they can access the specific study information and consent form
2. **Given** a participant is viewing a study consent form, **When** they read the PDF document and click "I Consent", **Then** their consent is recorded with timestamp and Bank ID verification
3. **Given** a researcher has created a new study, **When** they upload a consent PDF and configure study details, **Then** participants can access the study and provide consent
4. **Given** an administrator is viewing the consent dashboard, **When** they select a study, **Then** they can see all participant consent records with verification status

### Edge Cases
- What happens when Bank ID authentication fails or is unavailable?
- How does the system handle expired or withdrawn consent?
- What occurs when a participant tries to consent multiple times to the same study?
- How are consent records maintained for audit and compliance purposes?
